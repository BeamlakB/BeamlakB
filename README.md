## üìÇ Projects
###üîπ GritMarket Shopping Website

Students often struggle to find a safe and centralized way to buy and sell items on campus, relying on scattered channels like Discord or word of mouth. This project builds a dedicated marketplace platform to make peer-to-peer exchange easier, safer, and more organized for the UMBC student community.

###üîπ Disease Prediction

Patients frequently turn to the internet with symptom descriptions but find it difficult to connect those symptoms to potential conditions in a structured way. This project leverages LLMs and information retrieval techniques to help map patient-reported symptoms to likely diseases, improving accessibility of health insights.

###üîπ Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model

Unstructured and informal text often hides critical entities, making it hard for downstream systems to extract useful information. This project develops a high-accuracy NER model to reliably identify and extract entities from noisy text data, supporting more effective natural language understanding.
